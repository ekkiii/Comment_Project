This semester in Computer Science: Python Language, we focused on mastering the fundamentals of computational thinking and problem-solving using the Python programming language. We covered the topics of Python syntax, data types, program organization, algorithm design, and control structures. In addition to biweekly assignments, problem sets and unit assessments, students also worked in pairs on a bank customer service simulation project where they developed a program to effectively calculate and distribute the wait time to increase customer satisfaction at a bank.

Franz has a mediocre work ethic and student habits. He faithfully completes the unit assignments. In class, Franz is rarely engaged. He is comfortable asking questions during the larger class discussion but works not well in small groups with his peers. Additionally, he demonstrates good perseverance in the face of difficult tasks. Feel free to stop by our office or shoot our emails for any help!

Franz has suffered considerably from in-class tests. He has received D's on most tests, and has a test average of 69.125%, including a 60% on his cumulative final exam. I should admit that at this point, the best thing for him to do is to drop this class. Let us be realistic. Computer science is not for everybody. Dropping out would be much more beneficial for both Franz's and our own well beings. Take a VJ class instead, please!

It is difficult to start learning a programming language from scratch, and Franz was defeated by this challenge. With an overall grade percentage of 61.438%, Franz earned a D in this semester and I look forward to seeing his continued growth for the remainder of the year.
