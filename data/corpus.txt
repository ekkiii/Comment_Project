Cannon has a great work ethic and student habits. He faithfully completes the unit assignments. In class, Cannon is fully engaged. He is comfortable asking questions during the larger class discussion but works not well in small groups with his peers. Additionally, he demonstrates insufficient perseverance in the face of difficult tasks. Feel free to stop by our office or shoot our emails for any help!

Cannon has struggled with in-class tests. He has received B's on most tests, and has a test average of 77.625%, including an 80% on his cumulative final exam. I would strongly encourage Cannon to meet with me more frequently outside of class if he still intends to take Computer science classes in the future. For any problems or concepts which Cannon has trouble grasping, I am more than willing to explain them in-depth and provide extra problems with which he could practice. Otherwise, the only option to save his grade would be to drop this class.

On the exam, your functions were efficient, easy to read and welldocumented (+1 bonus point for that!).

On your bank customer service simulation partner project, you received a 96%. On the project, you elected to complete the challenging extension to the assignment, programming in a second teller the bank (you even made the teller part time, which was extremely business-savvy). Your collaboration and written code were both successful, and the only thing that could have improved the work was a bit more commenting.

In reflecting on your progress this semester right before the semester exam, you wrote:
